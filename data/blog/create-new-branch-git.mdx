## Introduction

Let's consider some different methods of creating a new branch locally in git.

## The default

Simply using "git branch" and the name of the branch will create a branch based on the currently checked out branch.

```
git branch <new-branch>
```

## Based on an existing branch

What if you want to create a branch based on some existing branch other than the currently checked out branch?

```
git branch <new-branch> <base-branch>
```

## Based on a commit or tag

What about creating a new branch based on a specific commit number?

```
git branch <new-branch> <commit-number>
```

What about creating a new branch based on a specific tag?

```
git branch <new-branch> v2.26.22
```

## Push new branch to remote repository

After working on your local branch, how do you push it to a remote repository?

```
git push -u origin <local-branch>
```
